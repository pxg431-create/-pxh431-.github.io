# Welcome to my website!

Hi! I’m Paulina Gonzalez, a first-year PhD student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Case Western Reserve University. I graduated with High Honors from Lehigh University in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Population Health and minors in Biostatistics and Probability & Statistics.

My work centers on population health, statistical methods, and the genetics and epigenetics of Alzheimer’s disease. I’m passionate about using rigorous, reproducible data science to address real-world public health challenges and improve health outcomes in diverse, underserved communities.
